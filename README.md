# Nodule
low level ( char parsing ) generalised XML parser for Haxe

The trace output of the main example, you can see how it's fairly easy to extract information.

nodule.Nodule is used to store nodes or attributes with data stored as a double linked tree structure, it keeps access to it's 'sisters' and it's firstChild and firstAttribute and to it's parent.

Added a parser that creates an XML structure.

Added toString for Nodule.

See Console log trace for the test here:

Best viewed in firefox rather than chrome because firefox will crop the xml print outs making it easier to see the timing results.
